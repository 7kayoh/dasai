Just going to reserve the repository and work on it when I have some time to spare.

*What the! That UI library is so not megoi~!*

The barebone UI components library in Fusion. Made for frontend developers to start working on their ✨ very own design system ✨.

## Avoid using this if you...
- Prefers accessibility
    - Because of the nature of how UI is rendered in Roblox and games. Accessibility is really hard to achieve as they are rendered via the engine in the game, not the native UI backend in the operating system you are in. Do not expect anything 100% accessibility friendly in this libary.
- Making Studio plugins
    - While it is possible for you to make plugins with this UI library. The cold fact is, you will be spending a lot of R&D to make the components ergonomic and Studio-native, just go find a Studio-replica UI components library for such things instead.
- Need something fancy
    - Suggested by the name! It's truly unfashionable and designed to be unfashionable. The user using this library is expected to modify the appearance/behaviour to match their own design system. We are providing the base functionality and hierarchy so frontend developers do not have to spend so much time to develop a consistent, cross-platform and somewhat-user-friendly UI library.
